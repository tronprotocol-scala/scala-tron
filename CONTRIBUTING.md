# Contributing
scala-tron is an open source project.

It is the work of contributors. We appreciate your help!

Here are instructions to get you started. They are not perfect, so please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, join our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Rovak/scala-tron) or [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/CP8XKBIjEc0RqzJdl61OlQ) with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct and you are requested to please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
<br />
## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Scala-tron follows [gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). Please open pull  requests to the develop branch. Once approved, we will close the pull request and merge into master branch.
3. If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged as it can be a possible oversight. Please explain your code as detailed as possible to make it easier for us to understand.


### Create issues

Any significant improvement should be documented as a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/Rovak/scala-tron/issues) before anyone
starts working on it.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

### Please check existing issues and docs first!

Please take a moment to check that your bug report or improvement proposal
doesn't already exist. If it does, please add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too".
This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body

nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or

when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
